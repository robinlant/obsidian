“All men have the stars but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent.  You–you alone–will have the stars as no one else has them–”  
“And at night you will look up at the stars.  
My star will just be one of the stars, for you. “In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night  
And so you will love to watch all the stars…  
You–only you–will have stars that can laugh.  
I shall not leave you”  
There is sweetness  
in the laughter of all the stars….  
and in the memories of those we love.”
